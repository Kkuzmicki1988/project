        <h1>Numb</h1>
        <h3> by Linkin Park</h3>
        <p>I'm tired of being what you want me to be
  			Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
  			I don't know what you're expecting of me
  			Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
  			Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
  			Every step that I take is another mistake to you
  			Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow</p>
    		<p>I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
  			Become so tired, so much more aware
  			By becoming this all I want to do
  			Is be more like me and be less like you</p>
    		<p>Can't you see that you're smothering me?
  			Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
  			'Cause everything that you thought I would be
  			Has fallen apart right in front of you
  			Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
  			Every step that I take is another mistake to you
  			Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
  			And every second I waste is more than I can take!</p>
  	  	<p>I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
  			Become so tired, so much more aware
  			By becoming this all I want to do
  			Is be more like me and be less like you
  			And I know I may end up failing too</p>
  	  	<p>And I know I may end up failing too
  			But I know you were just like me with someone disappointed in you</p>
  	  	<p>I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
  			Become so tired, so much more aware
  			By becoming this all I want to do
  			Is be more like me and be less like you</p>
  	  	<p>I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
  			I'm tired of being what you want me to be
  			I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
  			I'm tired of being what you want me to be</p>
